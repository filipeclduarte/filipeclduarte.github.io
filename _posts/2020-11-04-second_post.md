# Which programming language I should use for Computational Intelligence?

Let's face it ... Python is on fire! Right now, not only is Python in the second position in the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), but almost every Data Science and Machine Learning course teaches Python to their students! If you ask Google what the best programming language is for machine learning, you will see "Python!". This fact is part explained because the best libraries and frameworks for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence were first developed in Python. Not to mention, its community is big and very helpful.


From the time I'm writing this article, Python has two major frameworks to build artificial neural networks models - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). Python's [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the best library for machine learning. Make sure to check its excellent documentation. There are more than that, but these 2 are the most widely used nowadays.


Therefore, the fundamental problem still resides because Python is an interpreted and albeit slow language.
You could use [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (scientific computing library) and [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) (Just in Time compiler) to enhance your Python's program performance... However, they have some limitations. NumPy will get the most performance benefit by vectorization (but sometimes you still need to do for loops!). Numba may increase performance, but is not compatible with a lot of Python code (e.g. Pandas) and data structures like "dictionary." In this sense, you should know how to program in C/C++ if you need to develop something from scratch, and you know that C/C++ does not have a "syntactic sugar" like Python.


If you ask me what programming language you should learn to research Machine (Deep) Learning or develop and deploy models into production - I would tell you to learn Python. You will get the most benefit from that, and if you're seeking resources to learn Deep Learning and Python, I would tell you to visit [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/). Their course is one of the best and free. They teach Deep Learning with their library called [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and the previously mentioned Pytorch.
