# Which programming language I should use for Computational Intelligence?

Let's face it, Python is on fire! Almost every Data Science and Machine Learning course teachs Python to their students. 
If you ask google what is the best programming language for machine learning, you will find "Python!". 
This represents the actual moment, in part because the best libraries and frameworks were first developed in Python, 
also it's community is big and very helpful. 


By the time I write this article, 04/11/2020, Python have two big frameworks to building artificial neural networks models, Tensorflow and Pytorch. 
In fact, there are more than that, but those are the most mostly widely used nowadays. The problem still resides on the fact that Python is a slow language. 
You must know how to program in C/C++ if you need to develop something from scratch, and you know that C/C++ does not have a "syntactic sugar" like Python.
