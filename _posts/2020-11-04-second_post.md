# Which programming language should I use for Computational Intelligence?

Let's face it; Python is on fire! Python is now in the second position in the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Also, almost every Data Science and Machine Learning course teach Python to their students. If you ask Google the best programming language for machine learning, you will find "Python!". This fact represents the actual moment because the best libraries and frameworks for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence were developed in Python. Also, its community is big and very helpful.


By the time I write this article, 2020 november 4, Python has two major frameworks to build artificial neural networks models, [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). Python's [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  is the best library for machine learning. Make sure to check its excellent documentation. There are more than that, but those are the most widely used nowadays.


Therefore, the fundamental problem still resides because Python is an interpreted, also slow language.
You could use [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (scientific computing library) and [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) (Just in Time compiler) to enhance your Python's program performance. However, they have some limitations, such as NumPy will get the most performance benefit by vectorization (you will need to do for loops!). Simultaneously, Numba is not compatible with a lot of Python code (e.x. Pandas) and data structures like "dictionary." In this sense, you should know how to program in C/C++ if you need to develop something from scratch, and you know that C/C++ does not have a "syntactic sugar" like Python.


If you ask me what programming language should you learn to research Machine (Deep) Learning or develop and deploy models into production? Then I would tell you to learn Python. You will get the most benefit from that, and if you need one place to start to learn Deep Learning and Python, I would tell you to visit [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/). Their course is one of the best and free. They teach Deep Learning with their library called [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and Pytorch.
