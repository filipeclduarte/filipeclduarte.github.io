# Which programming language I should use for Computational Intelligence?

Let's face it; Python is on fire! Python is now in the second position in the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). 
Also, almost every Data Science and Machine Learning course teach Python to their students. 
If you ask google what is the best programming language for machine learning, you will find "Python!". 
This represents the actual moment, because the best libraries and frameworks for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are being developed in Python, 
also its community is big and very helpful. 


By the time I write this article, 04/11/2020, Python have two big frameworks to build artificial neural networks models, 
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). 
Besides, Python's [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the best library for machine learning. Make sure to check its excellent documentation. 
In fact, there are more than that, but those are the most widely used nowadays. 


Therefore, the fundamental problem still resides on the fact that Python is a slow language. 
You could use NumPy (scientific computing library) and Numba (Just in Time compiler) 
to enhance the performance of your Python's program but it's not that simple. 
NumPy has the limitation to improve the performance by vectorization (you will need to do for loops!), 
while Numba is not compatible with a lot of Python code (e.x. Pandas, ) and data structures like dictionary. 
In this sense, you must know how to program in C/C++ if you need to develop something from scratch, 
and you know that C/C++ does not have a "syntactic sugar" like Python. 


If you ask me what programming language should you learn now to research in machine (deep) learning or to develop and deploy models into production? 
Then I'll tell you to learn Python. You will get the most benefit from that, 
and if you need one place to start to learn deep learning and python, I would tell you to visit [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/). 
Their course is one of the best and totally free. They teach deep learning with their own library called [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and Pytorch.
