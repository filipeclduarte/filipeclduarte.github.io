# Ensemble Learning

Combine models achieve better results than using one model for classification Kuncheva (2014). Also, an ensemble classifier is just one classifier. 

Reasons to combine models:

 I. **Statistical**: It is better to average several models than choose only one. 
 
 II. **Computational**: Small sample size or too much data; Imperfect training algorithm. 
 
 III. **Representational**: Complex boundary can be approximated with the desired precision by simple boundaries. An ensemble of linear classifiers can approximate a highly nonlinear classification boundary. 

Three phases:

1. Generation

2. Selection

3. Fusion
