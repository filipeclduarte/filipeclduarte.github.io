# Introduction to Evolutionary Computation

## Introduction

What is evolutionary computing? 

It is a subfield of Computational intelligence which studies algorithms inspired by nature.  There are two main inspirations: i) Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and ii) Genetics. 

The following are the problems we can solve using evolutionary algorithms:

* Optimization
* Modeling
* Simulation

In a black-box model of computer systems, we have an input, a model, and an output. According to Eiben and Smith (2015), "this model's purpose is to represent some aspects of the world relevant to the particular application."
