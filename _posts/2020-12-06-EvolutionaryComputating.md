# Introduction to Evolutionary Computation

## Introduction

What is evolutionary computing? 

It is a subfield of Computational intelligence which studies algorithms inspired by nature.  There are two main inspirations: i) Darwinian Theory of Evolution, and ii) Genetics. 

The following are the problems we can solve using evolutionary algorithms:

* Optimization
* Modeling
* Simulation

In a black-box model of computer systems, we have an input, a model, and an output. According to Eiben and Smith (2015), "this model's purpose is to represent some aspects of the world relevant to the particular application."

In this sense, the model could be a formula to calculate the total route length from a list of consecutive locations or the statistical model tool to estimate the likelihood of rain tomorrow given some meteorological input data.
