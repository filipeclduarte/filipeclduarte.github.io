# Introduction to Evolutionary Computation

## Introduction

What is evolutionary computing? 

It is a subfield of Computational intelligence which studies algorithms inspired by nature.  There are two main inspirations: i) Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and ii) Genetics. 

The following are the problems we can solve using evolutionary algorithms:

* Optimization
* Modeling
* Simulation
